# PoniesCEPatch

**NOTE: This mod is temporary and will remain until the main mod receives proper CE compatibility.**

Patches the [Ponies of the Rim](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3223243284) mod to properly work with [Combat Extended](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3495749827). More specifically, it uses the existing patches as a base to improve compatibility by adjusting a few overlooked values and items.

Balance is preserved with the original patch. See the race patch files for more info.

The source code is available on [Github](https://github.com/Nikitaw99/PoniesCEPatch).
